## **Project Description**
This project is a full-stack decentralized application (DApp) built on the **Flare Coston2 testnet** to issue and verify **blockchain-secured certificates of achievement**.

The smart contract securely stores:
- Student Name  
- Course Name  
- Timestamp  
- Certificate ID  
- Owner / Issuer Address  

The frontend enables users to:
- Connect their wallet  
- Issue new certificates  
- Fetch and verify certificate details  
- View all certificate metadata on-chain  

This ensures certificates are **tamper-proof**, **transparent**, and **verifiable**.

## **Features**
### ✔ Smart Contract Functionality  
- Issue certificates  
- Fetch certificate details  
- Track certificate count  
- Publicly readable registry  
- Immutable on-chain records  

### ✔ Frontend Features  
- Wallet connection (MetaMask, WalletConnect)  
- Easy form-based issuance  
- Certificate lookup by ID  
- Transaction status indicators  
- Clean UI & responsive layout  

### ✔ Security  
- Certificates cannot be edited  
- Issuer is cryptographically verified  
- On-chain timestamps ensure authenticity

## **How It Solves the Problem**
Traditional certificates:
- Can be faked  
- Can be altered  
- Are difficult to verify  
- Require trust in the issuing institution  

### This DApp solves all these problems.

By storing certificate data on-chain:
- Every certificate is **permanently verifiable**
- Anyone can confirm authenticity
- No institution can modify records later
- Students own a **global, blockchain-backed credential**

This is ideal for:
- Bootcamps  
- Online courses  
- Hackathons  
- Skill verification platforms  
- Portfolio building  

Blockchain ensures **trustless verification**, removing fraud and increasing credibility.

## **Summary**
This project delivers a powerful, secure, and fully decentralized solution for issuing and verifying educational certificates.  
Built using **Next.js**, **wagmi**, **viem**, and **Flare testnet**, it demonstrates production-ready Web3 full-stack skills.
